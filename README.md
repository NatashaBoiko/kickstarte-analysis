# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project
In this project I had to find out how different compaigns proceed in relation to their launch dates and funding goals. Using the dataset I visualized in the line charts compaign outcomes based on their launch dates and their funding goals.

### Purpose
Find out and analyze the information that will help the next campaign become more successful. 


### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
By analyzing the points along the trend lines of the chart on the sheet "Theater Outcomes by Launch Date", we can see the month with  the most/least successful, failed and canceled outcomes. The month that launched the most successful based on the launched date was May. The month that has the most failed outcomes was October. If we click on each point of the line chart, we can see  the corresponding information 

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goal
The most successful goal range was less than 1000$ based on percentage successful, while the least successful range - 45000$ to 49999$. By reviewing the rusults we can determine that the lower goal has the bigger percentage of success. 
 

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
The first challenge of the roject was easy to me, we went through the similar example in the module. The second deliverable was little bit harder, it took me some time to determine the and pair criterias and ranges, but once I calculated the first cell, the rest was easy.


## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
We can see the most succesful outcome on the 2nd quartile from the launch date and closer to the end the results are getting even worse. 

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
Easier to get a successful outcome with a smaller goal. 

- What are some limitations of this dataset?
One of the limitations is the lack of integration with the company`s other systems. Also Excel has a limit of 1,048,576 rows by 16,384 columns. The other limitation is that we can`t add additional column in front of the existing column that we used in the formula and expect the Excel to autocorrect the formula. 
- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
We can build the table and chart to see what country had the most successful and failed outcomes. Also we can show the ratio of backer counts to the outcomes.
